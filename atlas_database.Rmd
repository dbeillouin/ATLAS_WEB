# ATLAS Database

We are currently compiling a large open database by requesting authors of tropical homegarden field studies to share their species inventories and trait data.

This collaborative effort aims to gather:

- Species lists from multiple regions  
- Functional traits linked to ecosystem services  
- Metadata on sampling protocols and management practices  

The database is under construction and will be made publicly available as soon as sufficient data have been aggregated.

Meanwhile, updates and progress reports will be posted regularly on this site.

For data contributions or inquiries, please contact the ATLAS project team.
