# ATLAS Database: Building a Collaborative Resource

The ATLAS database is currently under active development through a collaborative network of researchers sharing data from tropical homegardens worldwide.

Our core objective is to compile standardized **species inventories** from multiple homegardens across diverse regions. At minimum, we seek for each homegarden:

<div style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1em; border-left:4px solid #007acc; margin-bottom:1em;">
<ul>
<li>A comprehensive <strong>list of plant species</strong> observed;</li>
<li><strong>Geographic coordinates (GPS)</strong> of the homegarden location;</li>
<li><strong>Size or area</strong> of the homegarden;</li>
</ul>
</div>

Additional information—such as detailed **functional trait data**, **sampling protocols**, and **management practices**—is highly valuable and greatly enhances the analytical power of the database.

## Integration with Complementary Data Sources

To better understand the ecological and environmental context, we will link the homegarden data with relevant external datasets, including:

- **Soil characteristics** and classifications  
- **Climate variables** from global repositories  
- **Existing plant trait databases**  

This integrative approach will allow us to investigate how local conditions and plant traits jointly influence ecosystem services.

## Data Sharing and Access

The database will be openly accessible as soon as a critical mass of harmonized data is assembled. Meanwhile, we will provide regular updates and summaries of progress on this website.

We warmly invite researchers and institutions holding relevant data to contribute to this collective effort. Your collaboration is essential to build a robust, representative, and actionable dataset to support sustainable agroecological transitions.
