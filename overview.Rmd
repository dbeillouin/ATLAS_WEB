# ATLAS Project Overview

<img src="img/banner.png" alt="ATLAS Banner" style="width:100%; max-height:200px; object-fit:cover; margin-bottom:1em;" />

The ATLAS project advances the understanding of tropical homegardens by applying cutting-edge quantitative methods to unravel the complexity of their functional biodiversity and ecosystem services.

While homegardens are recognized for their multifunctionality and socio-ecological importance, their biological and management complexity has historically limited detailed ecological characterization. ATLAS addresses this challenge by integrating trait-based ecology with advanced statistical modeling to dissect the relationships between plant functional diversity and key ecosystem processes.

Our approach leverages recent developments in functional ecology, including trait hypervolumes, multivariate trait analyses, and trait-environment regressions, to capture the multidimensional diversity of species traits at the system level. This enables us to link functional diversity metrics directly to ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water regulation, and nutritional provisioning.

<ul>
<li>Creation and curation of a <strong>harmonized, high-resolution global database</strong> of plant functional traits specific to homegardens, encompassing diverse geographic and cultural contexts.</li>
<li>Development of <strong>robust workflows and reproducible analytical pipelines</strong> to quantify trait diversity and its functional implications across scales.</li>
<li>Systematic <strong>meta-analyses</strong> synthesizing global evidence on trait-service relationships to inform agroecological management and policy.</li>
<li>Exploration of the influence of <strong>agricultural practices</strong> on trait composition and ecosystem service outcomes within homegardens.</li>
</ul>
</div>

This research aligns closely with international sustainability agendas, contributing novel empirical insights to support resilient, biodiversity-friendly agroecosystems. It responds to the urgent need for scalable, mechanistic understanding of how plant trait diversity underpins ecosystem function in managed tropical landscapes.

By bridging ecology, agronomy, and data science, ATLAS fosters evidence-based strategies that enhance ecosystem service delivery while promoting sustainable livelihoods and climate resilience.

## A Global Collaborative Initiative

ATLAS is a collaborative effort that depends on contributions from researchers, practitioners, and communities worldwide. The project's strength lies in its ability to integrate diverse datasets from tropical regions, reflecting the rich variability of homegarden systems across different ecological and cultural contexts.

We actively seek partners who can share data, expertise, and field knowledge to expand and enrich our global database of homegarden species and functional traits. By pooling resources and harmonizing data collection protocols, ATLAS aims to build an unparalleled, open-access resource that accelerates research and supports practical agroecological solutions.

<ul>
<li>Participate in cutting-edge ecological research with direct applications for sustainable agriculture.</li>
<li>Access and contribute to an integrated platform for data sharing, analysis, and visualization.</li>
<li>Influence regional and global policies by providing robust scientific evidence on agroecosystem functioning.</li>
<li>Foster interdisciplinary partnerships spanning ecology, agronomy, social sciences, and data science.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Together, we can deepen understanding of how functional diversity shapes ecosystem services, enabling the design of resilient, productive, and biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes.
