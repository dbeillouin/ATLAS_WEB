# Methods and Collaborative Data Acquisition Strategy

The ATLAS project aims to build an extensive, harmonized database of plant species occurrences and functional traits within tropical homegardens worldwide. Given the complexity and diversity of these agroecosystems, assembling such a dataset requires a **broad collaborative effort** that goes beyond traditional literature reviews.

### A Collaborative Data Framework

Homegarden data are scattered across multiple sources: published papers, grey literature, unpublished datasets, and ongoing research projects. Many relevant species inventories and trait datasets remain inaccessible without direct collaboration. Recognizing this, ATLAS adopts a **multi-pronged data acquisition strategy** focused on active engagement with the scientific community, research institutions, and practitioners globally.

This strategy includes:

- **Systematic literature synthesis**, to identify and extract data from all available published sources;
- **Proactive outreach to original authors and data holders**, to access unpublished or supplementary data critical for robust analyses;
- **Partnerships with ongoing projects and networks**, to share data, standardize protocols, and foster co-development of analytical tools;
- **Open invitation for new data contributions**, recognizing that many researchers hold valuable datasets not yet shared publicly.

By combining these approaches, ATLAS strives to create a comprehensive, high-quality dataset that reflects the rich ecological and cultural variation of tropical homegardens worldwide.

## Literature Search and Eligibility Criteria

As part of our data acquisition, we performed a systematic literature search on **June 2, 2025**, in the **Web of Science Core Collection**, using the following query:



\`\`\`
("home garden" OR homegarden OR homestead* OR "household garden*") AND (species OR "species richness" OR "plant diversity" OR biodiversity OR "floristic composition")
\`\`\`


This search yielded **2,437 records**, supplemented by manual screening of references and citations to uncover additional relevant studies.

We included studies that:

<div style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1em; border-left:4px solid #007acc; margin-bottom:1em;">
<ul>
<li>Explicitly focused on <strong>homegardens</strong> as ecological systems;</li>
<li>Provided data from <strong>multiple homegardens</strong>, excluding single-case reports;</li>
<li>Documented plant species via <strong>field sampling or botanical inventories</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

We excluded reviews, conceptual articles without original data, and studies lacking direct species observations.

## Screening and Selection Process

Using the semi-automated platform **Abstrackr**, which leverages active learning to efficiently prioritize relevant abstracts, we screened **1,540 abstracts**. Screening was halted upon saturation—defined as 100 consecutive abstracts without further inclusion—yielding a final corpus of **300 studies**.

## Data Extraction, Harmonization, and Integration

From these studies, we manually extracted detailed metadata (e.g., study title, country, region, year), biological data (species counts, number of homegardens sampled), and ecological metrics (diversity indices, explanatory variables such as land use or management factors).

To ensure consistency, we standardized geographic names with the R package [`countrycode`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=countrycode) and applied uniform definitions for species richness and explanatory variables.

Importantly, because species-level data are often incomplete or embedded in supplementary materials, we prioritized contacting study authors to obtain raw or detailed datasets whenever possible. This direct collaboration ensures higher-quality data and fills critical gaps.

## Call for Collaboration and Data Contributions

While literature and author outreach form a strong foundation, the full potential of ATLAS depends on **active contributions from the global community**.

If you are a researcher, practitioner, or institution holding data on plant species occurrences or functional traits in tropical homegardens, we encourage you to join ATLAS by sharing your datasets. Contributions of any size or format are valuable and help:

<div style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1em; border-left:4px solid #007acc; margin-bottom:1em;">
<ul>
<li>Enhance the representativeness and completeness of the global dataset;</li>
<li>Support robust, trait-based ecological analyses at multiple scales;</li>
<li>Accelerate knowledge exchange and foster interdisciplinary collaborations;</li>
<li>Inform sustainable agroecological management and policy-making.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Data sharing within ATLAS respects contributors’ rights and includes proper attribution. We are committed to building a **transparent, collaborative, and mutually beneficial network**.
