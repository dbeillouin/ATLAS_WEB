Website of the research initiative ***ATLAS – Unlocking the Functional Diversity of Homegardens***,\
led by **CIRAD** in collaboration with international partners including the University of Toronto, CEFE-CNRS, CGIAR, and others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ATLAS** (Analysis of Traits in Homegardens and Links to Agroecosystem Services) explores the role of plant functional diversity in tropical homegardens and its contribution to resilient and sustainable food systems.

These homegardens — complex, multifunctional agroecosystems combining crops, trees, and livestock — are widespread across the tropics. They provide food, income, and essential ecosystem services to millions of rural households. Despite their importance, the **functional roles of plants in these systems remain poorly understood**.

## Scientific Focus

ATLAS investigates how the **functional traits** of plant species — such as leaf structure, nutrient content, or growth form — influence key ecosystem functions, including:

-   Carbon sequestration\
-   Water regulation\
-   Nutritional value\
-   Agroecosystem resilience

By applying tools from **functional ecology**, **trait-based analysis**, and **data science**, the project aims to generate new insights into the ecological functioning of homegardens.

## Objectives

ATLAS aims to:

-   Build a global, open-access **database** of species and plant traits in tropical homegardens\
-   Compare functional composition across homegardens, agricultural systems, and forest contexts\
-   Link plant traits to measurable **ecosystem services**\
-   Support **evidence-based agroecological transitions** and inform biodiversity and climate policies

## Project Team

The ATLAS project involves researchers from:

-   **CIRAD** (France)\
-   **University of Toronto** (Canada)\
-   **CEFE - CNRS** (France)\
-   **CGIAR / Bioversity International**\
-   **San Diego Botanic Garden**\
-   ...and other global partners
